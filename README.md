# 2DVehicleSimulation
Library that simulates a 2D vehicle that tracks a simple geometric 2D path

# Main classes
## PathSegment
linear segment between two points
## Path
a path connecting a series of waypoints
encapsulate the transformation between the path coordinates and the coordinates 
## Servo
actuator controlling the front wheel of the vehicle, 2nd order dynamics
## Vehicle
encapsulating the kinematics and the tracking algorithm of the vehicle
